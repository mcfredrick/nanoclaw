# NanoClaw Debug Checklist

## Known Issues (2026-02-08)

### 1. [FIXED] Resume branches from stale tree position
When agent teams spawns subagent CLI processes, they write to the same session JSONL. On subsequent `query()` resumes, the CLI reads the JSONL but may pick a stale branch tip (from before the subagent activity), causing the agent's response to land on a branch the host never receives a `result` for. **Fix**: pass `resumeSessionAt` with the last assistant message UUID to explicitly anchor each resume.

### 2. IDLE_TIMEOUT == CONTAINER_TIMEOUT (both 30 min)
Both timers fire at the same time, so containers always exit via hard SIGKILL (code 137) instead of graceful `_close` sentinel shutdown. The idle timeout should be shorter (e.g., 5 min) so containers wind down between messages, while container timeout stays at 30 min as a safety net for stuck agents.

### 3. Cursor advanced before agent succeeds
`processGroupMessages` advances `lastAgentTimestamp` before the agent runs. If the container times out, retries find no messages (cursor already past them). Messages are permanently lost on timeout.

## Quick Status Check

```bash
# 1. Are services running?
docker compose ps

# 2. Any running agent containers?
docker ps --filter "name=nanoclaw-" --format "{{.Names}} {{.Status}}"

# 3. Recent errors in service log?
docker compose logs nanoclaw --tail 50 2>&1 | grep -E 'ERROR|WARN'

# 4. Is Signal API connected?
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/accounts

# 5. Is NanoClaw healthy?
curl -s http://localhost:3002/health

# 6. Are groups loaded?
docker compose logs nanoclaw --tail 50 2>&1 | grep 'groupCount'
```

## Session Transcript Branching

```bash
# Check for concurrent CLI processes in session debug logs
ls -la data/sessions/<group>/.claude/debug/

# Count unique SDK processes that handled messages
# Each .txt file = one CLI subprocess. Multiple = concurrent queries.

# Check parentUuid branching in transcript
python3 -c "
import json, sys
lines = open('data/sessions/<group>/.claude/projects/-workspace-group/<session>.jsonl').read().strip().split('\n')
for i, line in enumerate(lines):
  try:
    d = json.loads(line)
    if d.get('type') == 'user' and d.get('message'):
      parent = d.get('parentUuid', 'ROOT')[:8]
      content = str(d['message'].get('content', ''))[:60]
      print(f'L{i+1} parent={parent} {content}')
  except: pass
"
```

## Container Timeout Investigation

```bash
# Check for recent timeouts
grep -E 'Container timeout|timed out' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -10

# Check container log files for the timed-out container
ls -lt groups/*/logs/container-*.log | head -10

# Read the most recent container log (replace path)
cat groups/<group>/logs/container-<timestamp>.log

# Check if retries were scheduled and what happened
grep -E 'Scheduling retry|retry|Max retries' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -10
```

## Agent Not Responding

```bash
# Check if messages are being received from Signal
docker compose logs nanoclaw --tail 100 2>&1 | grep 'New messages' | tail -10

# Check if messages are being processed (container spawned)
grep -E 'Processing messages|Spawning container' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -10

# Check if messages are being piped to active container
grep -E 'Piped messages|sendMessage' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -10

# Check the queue state — any active containers?
grep -E 'Starting container|Container active|concurrency limit' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -10

# Check lastAgentTimestamp vs latest message timestamp
sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT chat_jid, MAX(timestamp) as latest FROM messages GROUP BY chat_jid ORDER BY latest DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

## Container Mount Issues

```bash
# Check mount validation logs (shows on container spawn)
grep -E 'Mount validated|Mount.*REJECTED|mount' logs/nanoclaw.log | tail -10

# Verify the mount allowlist is readable
cat ~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json

# Check group's container_config in DB
sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT name, container_config FROM registered_groups;"

# Test-run a container to check mounts (dry run)
# Replace <group-folder> with the group's folder name
container run -i --rm --entrypoint ls nanoclaw-agent:latest /workspace/extra/
```

## Signal Auth Issues

```bash
# Check if Signal account is linked
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/accounts

# Re-link Signal account (open in browser)
# http://localhost:8080/v1/qrcodelink?device_name=nanoclaw

# Check signal-api logs
docker compose logs signal-api --tail 20
```

## Service Management

```bash
# View live logs
docker compose logs -f nanoclaw

# Restart NanoClaw only
docker compose restart nanoclaw

# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose build nanoclaw && docker compose up -d nanoclaw

# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Start all services
docker compose up -d
```
